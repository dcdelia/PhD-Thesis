Adaptive optimization techniques are a key ingredient for the performance of modern runtime systems. In this thesis we present novel ideas for adaptive optimization, ranging from profiling techniques (at both intra- and inter- procedural level) based on elegant data structures, to providing support for continuous program optimization through a flexible infrastructure for On-Stack Replacement (OSR).

We implement our ideas in production systems such as the Jikes RVM and the LLVM compiler infrastructure, and evaluate their performance against prominent benchmarks. We also present a first attempt to prove the correctness of on-stack replacement transitions, identifying sufficient conditions for their correctness and devising an algorithm for automatically generating compensation code to support OSR at arbitrary program locations in the presence of common compiler optimizations.
