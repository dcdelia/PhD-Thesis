%Context-sensitive profiling provides 
%These algorithms allow us to distinguish between hot and cold context on-the-fly, and we show both theoretically and experimentally that for collected metrics the HCCT achieves a similar precision as the CCT in a space that is several orders of magnitude smaller. We show on prominent benchmarks that our implementation, shipping as a plugin for the \gcc\ compiler, incurs a slowdown competitive with the \gprof\ profiler while collecting much finer-grained profiles.
