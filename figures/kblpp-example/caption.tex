\label{fig:kblpp-example} Control flow graph (CFG) with Ball-Larus instrumentation modified to emit acyclic path IDs to an output stream and running example of our approach that shows a 4-iteration path forest (4-IPF) for a possible small execution trace. Loop back edges in the CFG have been restored after the path numbering phase.
