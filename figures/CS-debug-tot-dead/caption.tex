\label{fig:CS-debug-tot-dead} Scatter plot of the total number of scalar user variables that are endangered by optimizations across program points. The position on the horizontal axis is determined by the number of instructions in each function's unoptimized version. For each selected benchmark we report both a log-log (left) and a linear (right) plot.
