\label{fig:osr-isordto} Faster variant of {\tt isord} (\myfigure\ref{fig:osr-isord}) in LLVM IR with comparator inlining, instrumented as OSR continuation function. Instrumentation additions are in grey. The original function entry block is unreachable after instrumentation and is eliminated (struck-through code fragments).
