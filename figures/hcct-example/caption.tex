\label{fig:hcct-example} (a) CCT annotated with calling-context frequency counts; (b) HCCT; and (c) $(\phi,\varepsilon)$-HCCT. Hot nodes are black. In this example $N=581$, $\phi=1/10$, and $\varepsilon=1/30$: the approximate HCCT includes all contexts with frequency $\ge\lfloor\phi N\rfloor=58$  and no context with frequency $\le\lfloor(\phi-\varepsilon) N\rfloor=38$.
