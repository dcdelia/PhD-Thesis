\label{fig:hcct-bursting} (a) Accuracy of frequencies measured on hot calling contexts when SS is combined with static bursting. (b) Hot edge coverage for decreasing values of the hotness threshold $\tau$. As pointed out in \mysection\ref{ss:hcct-accuracy}, $\widetilde\tau$ is the minimum threshold for which SS guarantees 100\% coverage when static bursting is disabled. We chose a representative subset of benchmarks for both charts; sampling interval has been set to 20 msec and burst length to 2 msec.
